    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  2
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      4,507 out of  69,120    6%
    Number used as logic:                    4,507 out of  69,120    6%
      Number using O6 output only:           2,458
      Number using O5 output only:               2
      Number using O5 and O6:                2,047

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,479 out of  17,280    8%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        4,507
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,423 out of   4,507   53%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of   4,507    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       2,084 out of   4,507   46%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               2 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        70 out of     640   10%

    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.03

Peak Memory Usage:  1114 MB
